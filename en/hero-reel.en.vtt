I’ve known Águila chocolate since I was a boy...

00:03.000 --> 00:06.500
back in the days of those hot chocolate parties, remember?

00:06.500 --> 00:09.500
Then came the chocolate cakes.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.500
Man, those were some cakes!

00:12.500 --> 00:15.500
That’s how I eventually discovered the "Submarino"...

00:15.500 --> 00:17.500
and later on, the mousses,

00:17.500 --> 00:19.000
the brownies,

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
the truffles,

00:20.000 --> 00:22.500
and these days, I’m crazy about the chocolate lava cake.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.500
Have you tried it?

00:23.500 --> 00:27.500
Águila chocolate has been my comfort for a very long time.

00:27.500 --> 00:30.000
Ever since I was... this little.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.500
[Laughs] Águila Chocolate: the gold standard in chocolate.
